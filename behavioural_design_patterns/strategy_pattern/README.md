# What is strategy pattern
===========

The strategy method is Behavioral Design pattern that allows you to define the complete family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and putting each of them into separate classes and also allows to interchange there objects. It is implemented in Python by dynamically replacing the content of a method defined inside a class with the contents of functions defined outside of the class. It enables selecting the algorithm at run-time. This method is also called as Policy Method.

# Where to use it?

Strategy pattern follows the Open/close principle; a software application is open for extension but closed for modification. It means you can add any number of additional strategies without modifying the main class. It makes your code more flexible and easy to maintain
